# GerrymanderingPhD
A demo project created for the purpose of a doctoral dissertation. It utilizes electoral data from GUS (Central Statistical Office) and object-oriented VBA programming to verify the claim that the shape of electoral districts can influence the election results in collegial body elections (using the example of the Silesian Voivodeship assembly).
