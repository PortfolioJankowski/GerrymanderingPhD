# GerrymanderingPhD
A demo project created for the purpose of a doctoral dissertation. It utilizes electoral data from GUS (Central Statistical Office) and object-oriented VBA programming to verify the claim that the shape of electoral districts can influence the election results in collegial body elections (using the example of the Silesian Voivodeship assembly).

The program involves exchanging counties between neighboring electoral districts in the Silesian Voivodeship and verifying the election outcome. It is particularly interesting as it is based on the legal principles outlined in the Polish electoral code.

Currently, the program iteratively swaps consecutive counties and has data for the year 2018. In the future, the program will be enhanced with an intelligent algorithm designed for county exchange (like pathfinding algorithm) and with electoral data from the years 2024 and 2014.
